# JET.jl

Use this skill for all JET work. Keep the overview here and load the narrow
reference that matches the task.

## Warning

Use JET only on the latest stable Julia release. Nightly and pre-release Julia
versions often break JET because it depends on compiler internals.

## Environment Rule

- Prefer package-integrated JET runs via `Pkg.test(...; test_args=["jet"])` or
  the package's documented JET arguments.
- Keep JET as a test-only dependency in `test/Project.toml` with root
  `[workspace] projects = ["test"]`; avoid new `[extras]`/`[targets]` entries.
- Avoid direct `test/runtests.jl` execution unless you are debugging the test
  router or worker behavior.
- Set `JULIA_PKG_SERVER_REGISTRY_PREFERENCE=eager` or
  `ENV["JULIA_PKG_SERVER_REGISTRY_PREFERENCE"] = "eager"` before `Pkg`
  operations in this workspace.
- Never read or edit `Manifest.toml` directly. If a JET failure appears after
  dependency churn, run `Pkg.update()` and `Pkg.resolve()` in the relevant
  package and JET environments first. If recurrent issues remain, delete the
  relevant `Manifest.toml` file and regenerate it with `Pkg.instantiate()`
  before blaming the analyzed code.

## Choose a Mode

- Start with `@report_opt` to find runtime dispatch and captured variables.
- Then use `@report_call` or `report_package` to find type-level errors.

## Quick Start

```julia
using JET

@report_opt sum(Any[1, 2, 3])
@report_call sum("julia")

using MyPackage
report_package(MyPackage; target_modules=[MyPackage])
report_file("my_script.jl")
```

## Filtering

```julia
@report_opt target_modules=(MyPackage,) my_function(args...)
```

Read JET stack traces from the bottom up: the bottom frame is the actual
problem site.
